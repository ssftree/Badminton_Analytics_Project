# 🏸 Badminton Player Movement Analytics

![Annotated video frame](results/Thumbnail.png)

A complete **computer vision–driven sports analytics project** that extracts, analyzes, and visualizes badminton player movement to generate **coach‑interpretable tactical insights**.

This repository demonstrates how raw video and trajectory data can be transformed into **advanced spatial analytics**, similar to methods used in professional sports performance analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern sports analytics goes beyond statistics, it focuses on **space, movement, and decision‑making**.\
This project analyzes badminton player positioning using trajectory data derived from match footage, pose estimation and shuttle detection.

The goal is to answer questions such as:

- Who controls which areas of the court?
- How do players transition between attack and defense?
- Where does physical pressure peak?
- How disciplined is a player’s positioning?

All insights are derived **purely from movement trajectories**, making the approach scalable and camera‑agnostic.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract player movement trajectories from video
- Normalize movements to a consistent court reference frame
- Quantify spatial dominance and court usage
- Compare players using interpretable visual analytics
- Present results in a **portfolio‑ready, research‑grade format**
- Detects the shuttlecock using a custom-trained YOLO11 model

The pipeline is modular and extensible, enabling future shot-type classification and rally-level analysis.

## 🎥 Demo

Below is a short preview of the annotated badminton analytics output.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – video processing
- **YOLOv8** – player detection
- **YOLOv8 Pose Estimation** – player joint detection
- **YOLO11 Object Detection** – shuttlecock detection (custom trained)
- **NumPy / Pandas** – data processing
- **Matplotlib** – scientific visualization
- **MoviePy** – video/audio handling
	

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Player Tracking & Trajectory Extraction

- Players are detected using YOLOv8 pose estimation
- The body center (or ankle midpoint) is used as the player position
- Trajectories are stored as `(x, y, time)` sequences

### 2️⃣ Court Normalization

- Raw coordinates are normalized to a **canonical court reference frame**
- This allows fair comparison across frames, rallies, and players

### 3️⃣ Spatial Analytics

- The court is divided into logical zones (Front/Mid/Back × Left/Right)
- Movement density, transitions, and dominance are computed

### 4️⃣ Shuttlecock Detection & Shot-Type Context (YOLO11)

- A YOLO11 object detection model is custom-trained to detect the shuttlecock
-Training data is sourced from an open-source Roboflow dataset

- Shuttle trajectories provide:

	- Temporal shot context

	- Spatial shot location

	-Player–shuttle interaction alignment

This enables shot-type analysis (e.g., smash, drop, clear) by combining:

- Shuttle movement patterns

- Player position and movement dynamics
